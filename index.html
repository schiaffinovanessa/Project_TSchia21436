                    <h3> Our Story </h3>
                    <br>
                    <p class="mainpa">
                    VanBallSports is a club that has been founded in 2015 by 3 people who liked sports very much.
                    <br>
                    The club has 3 types of courts and sports: Soccer, Tennis and Volleyball. 
                    Now, this club gives the opportunity to many athletes to have fun either playing 
                    with their friends or taking classes from the beginning to the most advanced level.
                    our location is in Marine Drive. However we are moving forward with the project 
                    to expand, as it has had a great attachment. 
                    For example, the next year we are going to open in 5 new location inside British Columbia.
